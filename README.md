# Cubinit
Cubidev's project creation tool for c++

Obs: Please note that I used some Linux Especific Librarys, so do not expect this to work with windows without some modification.

Usage:

./Cubinit [Project Name]

This will create:
- project folder ([Project Name]/)
- source folder ([Project Name]/src/)
- CMakeLists.txt file at project folder ([Project Name]/CMakeLists.txt)
- Hello World program at source folder ([Project Name]/src/main.cpp)
